This repository will solely have updates on my progress in learning to code. There won't necessarily be any code in this repo.

Yesterday (it's actually the 12th at the time I'm writing this) I began pulling things together to get my nose to the grindstone, I've had the tools, to some extent the time, but no motivation. I started to read the first of a few books I obtained from humble bundle a month or two ago, though I never got far. The book in question is 'Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming' by Eric Matthes. I have had more time recently and decided to give it a go with a full week off from work. I figured what's the worst that could happen amiright? Yesterday, I ran out to Best Buy and picked up the beefiest horse-poweriest tablet I could find, because I must have the technologies. It's an Insignia 10" from 2016. After loading the epub files on there I sat down with the book again and made it through roughly the first 50 pages albeit afk, so I had to go back to actually practice the exercises. In addition to that, my car needed to be jumped...twice...gotta love running family to appointments.

Today I uninstalled python and reinstalled it to see if it had any effect on the build/exe issues I was running into when starting out prior. To some degree this remedied the headaches, but the book isn't geared toward windows 10, and having gone through express installation I had some hiccups finding the executable location. I also pulled up a list of keyboard shortcuts to study and speed things up (eventually). Now I can run a command prompt without a mouse, who would've thunk? After tracking things down I reached out to my brother for help, as I am quite novice, in regards to bouncing questions off of him, I'm still waiting on his Slack invite. I signed up for CodesDope, GitHub and a few other things. I also customized my tablet experience to some degree.
